##### Stress-free task management system


# Taskmaster 4000 is a task management app for companies, teachers and even families that intends to alleviate tension and stress between the boss and their employees, teachers and their students and parents and their children.  Inspired by a research study called "Getting Things Done: The Science behind Stress-Free Productivity" by Francis Heylighen and Cl√©ment Vidal of the Evolution, Complexity and Cognition research group, the Taskmaster 4000 format is backed quantitative and qualitative reasearch from the best minds in the psychological productivity field.

# Taskmaster 4000 operates off these basic principles:
# 1. Bosses do not assign tasks to specific employees, rather the tasks are assigned to a pool
# 2. Employees are free to claim any task from the pool
# 3. Upon completion of the task, the employee recieve a points award
# 4. Tasks that remain unclaimed after 24 hours of posting, will recieve a points increment
# 5. The tasks continue to recieve points increments until they are claimed
# 6. points can be redeemed for rewards or used as performance reviews
