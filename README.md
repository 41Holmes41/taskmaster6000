# Taskmaster 6000 operates off these basic principles:
# 1. Bosses do not assign tasks to specific employees, rather the tasks are assigned to a pool
# 2. Employees are free to claim any task from the pool
# 3. Upon completion of the task, the employee recieve a points award
# 4. Tasks that remain unclaimed after 24 hours of posting, will recieve a points increment
# 5. The tasks continue to recieve points increments until they are claimed
# 6. points can be redeemed for rewards or used as performance reviews
